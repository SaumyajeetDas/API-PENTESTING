 - API rely on HTTP protocol.
	 - client/server relationship between the host of the API (provider or server) and the system or person making the API request (consumer or client)
	 
 - API consumer can request resources/data from an `API ENDPOINT`.
	 - `API ENDPOINT is a URL for interacting with part of the API.`
		 - Examples :-
			 - `https://example.com/api/v3/users/`
			 - `https://example.com/api/v3/customers/`
			 - `https://example.com/api/updated_on/`
			
- Types of resources/data :-
	- A `singleton resource` is a unique object, such as `/api/user/{user_id}`.
	- A `collection` is a `group of resources`, such as `/api/profiles/users`.
	- A `subcollection` refers to a `collection within a particular resource`. For example, ``/api/user/{user_id}/settings is the endpoint to access the settings subcollection of a specific (singleton) user`

# API GATEWAY & MICROSERVICE
![[Pasted image 20220706221430.png]]

- When a consumer requests a resource from a provider, the request passes  
through an API gateway, which is an API management component that acts as  
an entry point to a web application.
- End users can access an applicationâ€™s services using a plethora of devices, which  
are all filtered through an API gateway. The API gateway then distributes the requests to whichever microservice is needed to fulfill each request.
- The API gateway filters bad requests, monitors incoming traffic, and  
routes each request to the proper service or microservice. The API gateway  
can also handle security controls such as authentication, authorization,  
encryption in transit using SSL, rate limiting, and load balancing.
- A microservice is a modular piece of a web app that handles a specific  
function. Microservices use APIs to transfer data and trigger actions.
