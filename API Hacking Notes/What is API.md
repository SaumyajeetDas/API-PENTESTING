Example : 
- Zomato is the client using the `Google Maps API` in their system. Google is the server. Thus client - server relation is maintained.
- Zomato don't request Google Maps server but requests the `Google Maps API` 
- Then `Google Maps API` queries the Google Maps Server.
- Response --> Positive --> `Google Maps API` --> responses with the data to Zomato.
- Response --> Negative --> `Google Maps API` --> responses with some error to Zomato.
